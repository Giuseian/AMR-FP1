The study of Centroidal Dynamics plays a fundamental role in understanding and controlling humanoid robots \cite{CD}. Centroidal Dynamics refers to the dynamics of a robot projected onto its Center of Mass (CoM)—a uniquely critical point that represents the effective location of the robot’s entire mass and the point through which the resultant gravitational force acts. Despite the inherent complexity of humanoid robots, often modeled as multi-link chains with high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics, the behavior of their CoM follows simpler, more intuitive laws. By focusing on the motion and forces at the CoM, it is possible to capture the essential aspects of a robot's global dynamics without needing to model every individual joint and link in fine detail. This abstraction not only reduces complexity but also provides a powerful framework for planning, control, and stability analysis, ultimately enabling the design of more robust, agile, and human-like behaviors.

Thanks to these advantages, many reduced order models and control algorithms have been developed that incorporate the CoM and Centroidal Dynamics as key components. Among the earliest and most influential models is the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) \cite{LIPM}, a point-mass approximation that simplifies the robot’s dynamics by making two assumptions: (1) there is no angular momentum about the CoM, and (2) the CoM maintains a constant height. These assumptions allow the otherwise nonlinear centroidal dynamics to be linearized, greatly simplifying trajectory planning. Stability within this framework is maintained by ensuring that the Zero Moment Point (ZMP)—the point where the resultant ground reaction force would act—remains inside the support polygon formed by the robot’s feet.

To extend the capabilities of LIPM, the Variable-Height Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (VH-LIPM) \cite{VHLIPM} was introduced. This model relaxes the constant height assumption, allowing vertical CoM motion, thereby enabling more dynamic and versatile movements such as stepping on uneven terrain or climbing.

Another important model is the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) \cite{SLIP}, which represents the CoM supported by a massless, compliant leg modeled as a spring. Unlike the rigid models, SLIP captures the energy storage and return mechanisms crucial for running, hopping, and other dynamic gaits. The ability of SLIP to express vertical oscillations of the CoM makes it essential for modeling and analyzing dynamic, non-walking locomotion.

These reduced order models have been extensively used in trajectory optimization approaches for motion planning. Trajectory optimization involves defining a motion task through state variables, control inputs, cost functions, and constraints, and then solving for the trajectory that optimizes performance while respecting dynamic feasibility. The reduced models serve as simplified system representations within these optimization problems. For instance, LIPM-based trajectory planners might define the desired ZMP trajectory as a cost term or enforce ZMP constraints to guarantee stability. More advanced formulations integrate full centroidal dynamics, incorporating both CoM motion and base orientation, with stability constraints expressed through support polygons or centroidal wrench cones.

However, numerical trajectory optimization approaches often require fine time discretization—small time steps—to maintain solution accuracy, leading to a high number of decision variables. Moreover, feasibility is typically ensured only at discrete time nodes, and ensuring feasibility between these nodes remains a challenge.

\paragraph{Integration of Trajectory Optimization} If a closed-form solution to the dynamic model is available, it enables trajectory generation using far fewer decision variables while ensuring feasibility at all times, not just at discrete points. Some methods have attempted to derive closed-form or analytical solutions for centroidal dynamics, often through simplifying assumptions such as constant CoM height or neglecting vertical-axis rotation. While these approaches are beneficial for efficiency, they limit the applicability of the resulting motions, particularly for more complex tasks like multi-contact planning or acrobatics. One technique for analytical integration involves assuming constant contact wrenches over finite time intervals (zero-order hold), but this introduces unwanted angular momentum variations unless extremely small time steps are used. To address this limitation, the multi-contact Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (mc-LIPM) was proposed, modeling contact forces through a stiffness-displacement relationship between the CoM and the contact points. This method allows for larger integration steps—potentially spanning entire contact phases—without significant angular momentum disturbances. Nevertheless, while mc-LIPM improves over traditional LIPM approaches, it still lacks full expressiveness for modeling complex rotational dynamics. Despite their success, these reduced order models introduce fundamental limitations. LIPM and VH-LIPM are built on strong assumptions that oversimplify the nonlinear nature of real-world dynamics, restricting their use in highly dynamic or irregular environments. SLIP preserves more physical realism but lacks a closed-form solution, complicating its analytical handling in optimization frameworks. Moreover, trajectory optimization methods based on these models often lead to large-scale optimization problems that are computationally expensive, challenging their application to real-time control.
\paragraph{Limitations} These simplifications may be tolerable for basic locomotion tasks such as walking or slow stepping, but they become inadequate for advanced applications like multi-contact maneuvers, dynamic manipulation, or acrobatic motions, where high-fidelity and continuous-time feasibility are crucial. Additionally, the lack of closed-form solutions exacerbates the computational burden, making fast online planning difficult. To overcome these challenges, a novel stiffness-based method is introduced. This approach provides a closed-form solution to the trajectory optimization problem by modeling the interaction forces through stiffness relationships. It enables the generation of long, dynamically feasible trajectories with far fewer decision variables, offering better computational efficiency and making real-time, complex motion generation more practical and reliable.
