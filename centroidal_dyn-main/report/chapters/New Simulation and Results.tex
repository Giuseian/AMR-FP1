\section{New Simulation and Results}
\label{sec:newsimulation}
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory optimization framework, we consider two representative tasks: static balance and walking. Reference trajectory generation algorithms have been developed for each task, with corresponding implementation details including the initialization of cost weights, time discretization parameters, and control bounds. The resulting trajectories are obtained by solving the centroidal dynamics using both stiffness-based and direct closed-form formulations, and are analyzed through quantitative metrics and visual plots. The validity of these trajectories is further demonstrated through simulation of the HRP-4 humanoid robot executing the respective tasks.

Before presenting the results, we clarify that contact states are defined over the set $\{-, 0\}$, where $0$ denotes foot contact with the ground and $â€“$ represents a swing phase. All trajectories are described with respect to discrete contact phases rather than continuous time. Additionally, several parameter settings are shared across both tasks; to improve clarity and avoid redundancy, these common initializations are reported only once in the appropriate subsection.
